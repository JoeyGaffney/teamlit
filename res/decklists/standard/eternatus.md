## Discussion
### Pokemon
- 4 of each core basic makes it easier to hit max damage.
- **Yveltal TEU** is good for its natural free retreat and special energy removal.
- **Hoopa** is a good dark attacker.
- **Potential Techs**:
    - **Galarian Weezing**: for the mirror matchup to force your opponent to constantly discard their bench to 5.

### Trainers
- **Supporters**
    - **3 Professor's Research/3 Marnie** is a bit low but you play 4 Crobat V to compensate.
    - **3 Boss's Orders** is very necessary. Chasing knock outs wins you games.
    - **Mallow & Lana** is to prevent two-shots for a big swing turn.
- **Items**
    - **3 Scoop Up Net**, you could get away with 2 but the extra ping is nice.
    - **Air Balloon is for when you can't afford to attach a Hiding energy.
    - **Potential Techs:**
        - **Turbo Patch/Energy Switch**: a good combo to pull attacks out easier.
- **Stadiums**
    - **Black Market Prism Star** is a great stadium that makes your Hoopas OP.

### Energy
- Pretty standard. 11 total makes it so you don't whiff attachments early on.
