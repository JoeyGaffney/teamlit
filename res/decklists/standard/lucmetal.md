## Discussion
### Pokemon
- At the bare minimum you can run reduced counts of any of the attackers. The Pokemon line is very flexible in general. 
- **Potential Techs**:
    - **Duraludon RCL 138** wins the decidueye matchup since they do zero damage with goggles on.
    - **Meltan/Melmetal-GX SM178** has the equivalent of 310HP with Goggles and Full Metal Wall activated. Good as a Stage 1 attacker if afraid of Goons.

### Trainers
- **Supporters**
    - You can choose the high counts of Tag Team supporters yourself. Cynthia & Caitlin is a cop out, allowing you to just reuse the supporters you want to. Running extra Mallow & Lana or Marnie depends on the meta you expect.
- **Items**
    - **Metal Goggles** is the lifeblood of this deck. While Tool Scrappers are low in count in decks, this will be a good deck.
    - **Tag Call** engine works fine
    - **4 Quick Ball** is unnecessary, having a way to search Bronzong would be better. A 2/2 or 3/2 split of Quick Ball/Communication is ideal.
- **Stadiums**
    - **Chaotic Swell** is decent and gives another target for Guzma & Hala.

### Energy
- **Capture** turn 1 on Melmetal into Zacian draw if first or Full Metal Wall if second is great. Not necessary though so I only play 2.
