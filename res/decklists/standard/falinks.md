## Discussion
### Pokemon
- Falinks/Falinks V. You do not need to run any other Pokemon in the deck. With 4 Falinks V and a Cape, your regular Falinks have the equivalent of 220HP and your Falinks V become tanks with 290HP.

### Trainers
- **Supporters**
    - Boss's Orders. You could run 4 however I didn't see it as necessary. 3 is enough for 3 Crobat V/Dedenne GX.
    - Sonia is a great card. Search for 2 Falinks V means you take 40 less damage and do 60 more. The option to search for energy in the mid-late game is also useful.
- **Items**
    - Quick Ball/Great Ball. If there was a better option instead of Great Ball, I would pick that. They will fail 80% of the time in the early game but become a bit better when your deck is thinner and you rod in some Falinks.
    - Reset Stamp wins games. You can play them early for extra disruption and still easily find them late game once a few Falinks have fallen.
- **Stadiums**
    - Martial Arts Dojo lets you one-shot Eternatus VMAX if you are behind on prizes. You need to attach a fighting energy but it's definitely worth it.

### Energy
- 6 Fighting sometimes feels like too much. You could get away with 4 but being able to draw into them without having to rely on Sonia is nice to have.
