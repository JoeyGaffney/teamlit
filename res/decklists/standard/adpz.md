## Discussion
### Pokemon
- **2 Dedenne-GX** is enough, they are mostly used to save the game rather than set up.
- **Techs:**
    - **Zamazenta V** is good against Eternatus VMAX mostly. 
    - **Milotic V** one shot's Centiskorch VMAX to make the matchup better.
    - **Duraludon RCL** is great for Decidueye.
    - **Mawile-GX** is great for punishing people who hold their Dedenne-GX/Crobat V.

### Trainers
- **Supporters**
    - Boss's Orders is the best card in this deck as it will often result in taking 3 prizes. 
    - Between the **Tag Call* engine and the vanilla draw supporter engine, I prefer the vanilla since it is overall more consistent. 
- **Items**
    - Metal Saucer gives you comeback potential or early burst. Great card all around.
    - The flip version aims to burst with **Turbo Patch**, **Metal Saucer**, and **Energy Switch**. Then chase kills with **Pokemon Catcher**. It is not good but you can sometimes cheese out wins from nothing.
- **Stadiums**
    - **Chaotic Swell* for winning stadium wars.

### Energy
- **8 Metal** is good enough, you could also run 9 Metal and 3 Aurora.
